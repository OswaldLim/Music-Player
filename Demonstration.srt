1
00:00:03,147 --> 00:00:04,935
Uh hello everyone. Today I'm going to

2
00:00:04,935 --> 00:00:06,747
like them present and demonstrate about

3
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:08,182
my music player app that I have made

4
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:10,818
using Python And this is my code. I have

5
00:00:10,818 --> 00:00:12,394
imported like firstly I have imported the

6
00:00:12,394 --> 00:00:14,347
necessary modules like TK, enter, pie,

7
00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:16,229
game, time, mutagen, threading, pile,

8
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,794
image and random and these are the

9
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:20,818
the path of for the files that I'll be

10
00:00:20,818 --> 00:00:22,794
using. Which are the name list for the

11
00:00:22,888 --> 00:00:24,465
accounts, the database for the music and

12
00:00:24,488 --> 00:00:27,482
I mean and playlist is. The playlist for

13
00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:29,788
individual users and here are the files.

14
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:31,718
So this name file consists of the.

15
00:00:32,871 --> 00:00:34,400
The e-mail address,  thepassword and this

16
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,612
is a user ID that I've given to each new

17
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:39,576
new user and playlist is for each.

18
00:00:39,829 --> 00:00:40,982
This is the user ID and this is their

19
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:42,982
playlist for each users in the song DB in

20
00:00:42,982 --> 00:00:44,488
some database. Here are all the songs

21
00:00:44,488 --> 00:00:46,206
that I currently have. And yeah this

22
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:48,229
sound did we just stores all the song

23
00:00:48,276 --> 00:00:49,241
name of the songs that I currently have

24
00:00:49,241 --> 00:00:51,741
in my database. No. Yeah in this in this

25
00:00:51,741 --> 00:00:52,635
is like initializing some of the

26
00:00:52,635 --> 00:00:53,247
variables.

27
00:03:02,135 --> 00:03:03,947
Now this is so the playlist will be

28
00:03:03,947 --> 00:03:05,264
empty. Since you're using a sketch, your

29
00:03:05,264 --> 00:03:06,441
playlist won't be saved and you won't

30
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:08,582
have a playlist. And you can open your

31
00:03:08,582 --> 00:03:09,617
playlist here using this button. Here

32
00:03:09,806 --> 00:03:11,029
this is like the volume control and all

33
00:03:11,029 --> 00:03:12,464
this is the shuffle button and this is

34
00:03:12,464 --> 00:03:13,664
the loop button. This is backward.

35
00:03:13,988 --> 00:03:16,529
Forward, Start, Pause and end button. You

36
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,494
click this button to close out of the

37
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:19,312
program. And now let's

38
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,401
But if you log in as a guest and next

39
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,095
time, your playlist still won't be there.

40
00:04:03,095 --> 00:04:04,822
And that's like the one of the bad things

41
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:06,295
about log using my music player as a

42
00:04:06,295 --> 00:04:09,085
guest. Now for the register and login

43
00:04:09,085 --> 00:04:10,369
functions. So you will need to register an

44
00:04:10,369 --> 00:04:12,295
 e-mail first. Uh, the e-mail format has

45
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,085
to be correct. Or else it will if you

46
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:15,474
click register typing anything, OK, it

47
00:04:15,474 --> 00:04:16,801
was pop up an error. To show that you'd

48
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,822
have to type in a valid e-mail format@

49
00:04:18,148 --> 00:04:19,517
whichisexamplemail. com or something

50
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:22,038
else. So uh, even if you only type like

51
00:04:22,038 --> 00:04:24,480
 1.1 some, uh add something, it still

52
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,217
won't work. You need to have the full

53
00:04:25,217 --> 00:04:25,680
 e-mail format.

54
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,780
I'll just type in the random e-mail 6 and

55
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,106
this button is show to show the password

56
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:33,727
that we've typing like more for more

57
00:04:33,727 --> 00:04:35,874
privacy. What is your? I'll just type it.

58
00:04:35,874 --> 00:04:37,622
Yeah, register. OK, successfully register

59
00:04:37,622 --> 00:04:38,359
and now it will bring us back to that

60
00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:39,222
music player and we can log in using

61
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:40,569
the e-mail that  you'veregistered. I see

62
00:04:40,569 --> 00:04:42,780
it's a bad. As it is.

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,648
OK.

64
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:51,980
Name.

65
00:04:54,232 --> 00:04:55,517
156 7456. com.

66
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:05,106
And now we're in the music players and we

67
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,306
can add songs. As as in as, like with the

68
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,253
guest you can just add some any songs

69
00:05:08,253 --> 00:05:09,011
that you like and you can play them.

70
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,548
Like so for the loop function. I'll show

71
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:19,432
you that it works using the loop

72
00:05:19,432 --> 00:05:21,853
function. So basically when the song

73
00:05:21,853 --> 00:05:23,306
finishes playing they will auto repeat

74
00:05:23,306 --> 00:05:23,769
the song again.

75
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:49,161
it for my music player and to show some

76
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:51,177
error handling. We're logging, We're

77
00:06:51,177 --> 00:06:54,104
logging in. So when you're registering an

78
00:06:54,104 --> 00:06:57,072
 e-mail. We've already

79
00:06:57,072 --> 00:06:58,230
registered that e-mail, so if we register

80
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,840
this e-mail again, it will show that. An

81
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:01,683
account has already been registered using

82
00:07:01,683 --> 00:07:02,672
the same e-mail and if we type in the

83
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,098
password. So you've received an e-mail

84
00:07:04,098 --> 00:07:04,835
and we type in the password that is

85
00:07:04,835 --> 00:07:06,035
lesser than 8 characters, it'll it'll

86
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:06,961
it'll pop up a message saying invalid

87
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,072
password. And if we try logging in.

88
00:07:10,504 --> 00:07:11,430
156. com.

89
00:07:14,983 --> 00:07:15,783
And if you type in the wrong password, it

90
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:16,856
would just pop up incorrect password.

91
00:07:16,856 --> 00:07:17,761
It'll deny our access to the music,

92
00:07:17,761 --> 00:07:18,583
video, music player.

93
00:07:31,804 --> 00:07:33,404
And if you're playing and no matter if we

94
00:07:33,404 --> 00:07:36,272
pause, like. Re pause the song, the

95
00:07:36,272 --> 00:07:37,219
animation will also stop along with the

96
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,588
songs we need to continue. It will just

97
00:07:38,588 --> 00:07:39,725
keep on moving. We stop the sound

98
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:40,756
completely. This will return to 0 and the

99
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:43,656
animation will. OK, yeah, that's it for

100
00:07:43,656 --> 00:07:44,161
the music player.
